# 🚀 ATS Insight – AI Resume Analyzer (MERN + Gemini AI)

Resume Scan is a full-stack AI-powered web application that analyzes resumes using ATS (Applicant Tracking System) principles. Users can upload a PDF or DOCX resume, optionally provide a job description, and receive a detailed AI-generated evaluation including ATS score, keyword analysis, strengths, weaknesses, formatting suggestions, and actionable improvements.

The project is built using the MERN stack and integrates Google's Gemini AI for intelligent resume analysis.

# ⚙️ How It Works

## Step 1 — Upload Resume

The user uploads a PDF or DOCX resume through the React frontend.

The file is sent to the Express backend using multipart/form-data.

---

## Step 2 — Text Extraction

The backend extracts text from the uploaded file.

Libraries used:

- pdf-parse (PDF)
- mammoth (DOCX)

If the uploaded document is scanned or contains insufficient text, the application returns an appropriate error message.

---

## Step 3 — AI Analysis

The extracted resume text, along with an optional job description, is sent to Google Gemini.

Gemini evaluates the resume and returns:

- Overall Score
- ATS Compatibility
- Matched Keywords
- Missing Keywords
- Resume Sections
- Formatting Issues
- Strengths
- Improvements
- Summary

---

## Step 4 — Database Storage

Every analysis is stored in MongoDB Atlas.

Stored information includes:

- Resume filename
- Extracted text
- Job description
- AI analysis
- Timestamp

Users can later view or delete previous analyses.

---

## Step 5 — Display Results

The frontend displays the AI analysis in a clean interface with separate sections for:

- ATS Score
- Keyword Match
- Strengths
- Improvements
- Formatting Issues
- Overall Summary
